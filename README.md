 --> Now FOR.EG I want to use the 3rd one, The 3rd Option will obfuscate your script first and then Compile it to EXE,
     This is the main Reason why this is very important for Hackers who program their Malwares on their own!
 --> In Order to Use any Options just type
     use 1
     use 2
     use 3
 --> After you choose your option. All you have to do is give the Path where your script is present
