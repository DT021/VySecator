# Using the Program
 --> Now In order to run the program, Just run using this command, Also refer to the Screenshot below.
 
 `python ./VySec.py`
 
![Main menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67494275/88782664-77ef3680-d1ab-11ea-894e-8db597bcdb4d.PNG)

 --> Now you will see 4 options as Follows
 
 --> Now FOR.EG I want to use the 3rd one, The 3rd Option will obfuscate your script first and then Compile it to EXE,
     This is the main Reason why this is very important for Hackers who program their Malwares on their own!
     
 --> In Order to Use any Options just type
 
     use 1
     use 2
     use 3
     use 4
     
 --> After you choose your option. All you have to do is give the Path where your script is present
 
![options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67494275/88782819-a79e3e80-d1ab-11ea-8e1a-1b2c518b753f.PNG)


 --> Now It will start doing the things sit back and relax!
 
 --> After it completes you will see something like this at the end

--> Now to find the script, You can see in the image above a Blue Line is there, The final EXE will be in that path.

--> See the final path of our test script here

# Why removed Windows Version?

**I had to remove the Windows Version because this program is mainly made for Ethical Hackers, 
Which makes it easy for using them in Kali Linux ;)**
      
# What's new in Future Update 1.1.6 ?

**--> In the new Update which is 1.1.6, I will be adding a option through which people can 
      add their own icon to the EXE which will be generated by VySecator.**
      
**--> A text file which will contain all information about common errors which you get and how to fix them ...**
