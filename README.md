# VySecator
Vysecator Is a Python Script Obfuscator Tool

It uses a combination of Pyarmor and PyInstaller, I would love to thank the Pyarmor and PyInstaller DEVS for making such a useful tool. 
I have made this script so that it can be easy for people who don't know how to use Pyarmor or PyInstaller.

Use this command for Installing VySecator.

git clone https://github.com/VySec-Secure/VySecator.git

Make Sure you have PYTHON3, Script is not compatible with Python Version 2

Run the VySecator.py using 

python3 ./VySecator.py
