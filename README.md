# Installation

It uses a combination of Pyarmor and PyInstaller, I would love to thank the Pyarmor and PyInstaller DEVS for making such a useful tool. 
I have made this script so that it can be easy for people who don't know how to use Pyarmor or PyInstaller.

There are 3 options available in VySecator

**1. Obfuscate**

**You can choose any of these options, All you have to do is, Select option and give Path of the Python Script which you wanna compile.**
**ALL THE EXE OR THE OBFUSCATED PYTHON SCRIPTS WILL BE GENERATED IN A FOLDER CALLED dist, dist FOLDER WILL BE PRESENT IN THE DIRECTORY WHERE THE VySecator.py IS PRESENT.
